         <p class="para">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My name is Ibrahim originally from East Africa,Ethiopia at a village
            called Haro
            specifically <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/VJD62WJAh4ahE4LbA"> here</a> on google map. I have three
            sisters and two brothers. I am the youngest in the family.When I was 1 ½ years old my father died.
            Haro (a village where I was born ) is a rural part of Ethiopia where electricity is not available.Still
            now my mother lives there and uses firewood for cooking

         <p class="para"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In 2000G.C I enrolled in grade one. I attend from grade one to grade six
            at Taye
            elementary school which is approximately 1.5mile(30 minutes walk) from my home.But when I completed
            grade six ;there is no school near our village ,except Lemi secondary school(which I attended grade
            seven and grade eight ) which is approximately 3mile(an hour walk) away from home.
            When I joined grade nine ,it was impossible to walk everyday to school from my home.So I have to live
            nearby the school (Wegedi high school) But every weekend and every break time I go home to help my
            family (farming ,cattleing).
            Below in the table you can see my educational flow.
